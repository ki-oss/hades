# Hades Overview

HADES (HADES Asynchronous Discrete-Event Simulation) is a small, user friendly framework for creating simulations in python!


* üé≤ü§ñ **Supports both Agent Based and Process Based models** - how you model the entities in your simulation is up to you!
* ‚ö° **Async execution within a time-step** - makes working with distributed systems easy and makes improving simulation performance simple.
* üè∑Ô∏è **Pydantic style events** - gives type hints and enforcement, making it easy to see what an event will contain and improving developer experience
* üì¶ **Encapsulated simulated processes** processes or agents are encapsulated, keeping state manageable and processes easy to swap in or out

## Getting Started 

```bash
pip install hades-framework
```

```python
from hades import Hades, Process, Event
```
